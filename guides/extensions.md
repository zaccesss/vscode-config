# Extensions, in detail

What every installed extension does and when it actually gets used. Grouped the same way as the `//` headers in [`extensions.txt`](../extensions.txt).

## C/C++ and embedded

- **`ms-vscode.cpptools`** and **`ms-vscode.cpptools-extension-pack`** - Microsoft's C/C++ language support (IntelliSense, debugging, formatting). `C_Cpp.intelliSenseEngine` is set to `disabled` here specifically because `clangd` (below) replaces its IntelliSense. The pack's debugger and other tooling are still used.
- **`ms-vscode.cpptools-themes`** - Icon and colour theme bundled with the C/C++ extension pack.
- **`ms-vscode.cpp-devtools`** - Additional C/C++ developer tooling from Microsoft's own extension family.
- **`ms-vscode.cmake-tools`** - CMake project configuration, build and debug integration.
- **`stmicroelectronics.stm32cube-ide-*`** (11 extensions) - the full STM32Cube IDE toolchain ported to VS Code: core, build analyzer, bundled CMake, bundles manager, `clangd`-based IntelliSense, debug core plus 3 debugger backends (generic GDB server, J-Link, ST-Link), project manager, register viewer, RTOS awareness. Used together for STM32 microcontroller firmware development, this is why `stm32cube-ide-core.enableOfflineMode` is set in `settings.json`.
- **`stmicroelectronics.stm32-vscode-extension`** - the top-level STM32 extension that bundles and coordinates the `stm32cube-ide-*` set above.
- **`eclipse-cdt.memory-inspector`** - live memory view during embedded debugging, reading raw memory at a given address while a debug session is attached.
- **`eclipse-cdt.serial-monitor`** - a serial port monitor built into VS Code, for reading UART output from a connected board without a separate terminal tool.
- **`llvm-vs-code-extensions.lldb-dap`** - LLDB debugging via the Debug Adapter Protocol, an alternative debugger backend to GDB for native code.
- **`platformio.platformio-ide`** - PlatformIO's embedded development platform (build systems, board definitions, library management) for embedded projects outside the STM32Cube ecosystem.
- **`wokwi.wokwi-vscode`** - Wokwi's embedded hardware simulator, runs and debugs microcontroller firmware against a simulated board without real hardware attached.
- **`marus25.cortex-debug`** - ARM Cortex-M debugging (register/peripheral views, RTOS awareness, SVD-based memory maps). Added because the `stm32cube-ide-*` set contributes no VS Code commands of its own, this is the extension that actually gives the embedded workflow a bindable debug command.
- **`mcu-debug.peripheral-viewer`**, **`mcu-debug.memory-view`**, **`mcu-debug.rtos-views`** and **`mcu-debug.debug-tracker-vscode`** - installed automatically as Cortex-Debug's own dependencies, provide the peripheral register view, live memory inspection, RTOS thread view and the debug session tracker it builds on.
